This project is built around either a webapplication or an app where the user can put in their areas of interest, such as history and food, and get a custom tourist attractions reccomended. 

This project will consist of a GUI written in javascript and react.  A backend that will be written in java or python. The backend takes in the written info from the front end processes it using NLP, and feeding this into the algorithm that uses an API to get recommended spots, filters through these and then sends it back to the frontend to get shown to the user.
